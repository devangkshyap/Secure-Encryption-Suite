# Secure-Encryption-Suite
Secure Encryption Suite is a web-based cryptography tool that enables secure text and file encryption using AES-GCM (password-based) and RSA hybrid encryption. It supports key pair generation, digital signatures, hashing, and session-only audit logs, providing a practical and secure environment for learning and applying modern encryption techniques
